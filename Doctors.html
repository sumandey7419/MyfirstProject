            <p class="name">Dr Antonio Cassanello Layana</p>
            <p class="Info">Nino Cassanello Layana taught his medical students what he called the “principle of
                 responsibility”. He believed that students needed to get to know their patients on a personal
                  level and he encouraged them to ask about “not just the medical problems, but what kind of job 
                  he does, where he lived, what about his family”, said Cristobal Sanchez Metz, an 
                  adult hospitalist specialising in internal medicine in Washington, USA, who studied under 
                  Cassanello for 3 years.

                  Cassanello was even willing to help teach those who were not enrolled in his programmes. And they 
                  regularly sought him out, according to his son, Jerónimo Cassanello, a physician in the intensive 
                  care unit of Hospital Luis Vernaza, where his father also worked: “He was a very patient and
                  motivating teacher and a captivating conversationalist.”

            <p class="name"> Dr Raffaele Pempinello </p>
            <p class="Info">
                As the COVID-19 pandemic battered Italy's health system in March and April, doctors around the country
                 came out of retirement to assist. Raffaele Pempinello was no exception. When a friend of his fell 
                 ill with COVID-19, Pempinello, an infectious disease specialist who had retired in 2013, offered to help,
                  telling his wife that a doctor could never refuse to treat a patient. A week later, Pempinello tested 
                  positive for COVID-19 and died several weeks later.

                  “He was always prone to help people”, said Roberto Monarca, past President and current Scientific Director
                   of Health Without Barriers, a network of European organisations and experts advocating for healthy prison 
                   environments, who worked with Pempinello on a prison health project for the Italian Society of Infectious
                    and Tropical Diseases. “He was really a person who showed kindness, humanity, and solidarity for people. 
                    I don't wonder that he was a volunteer in this bad period.”

             <P class="name">Dr. Li Wenliang</P>
             <p class="Info">
                The death that broke several hearts in the initial days of coronavirus spread was of Dr. Li Wenliang, a Chinese ophthalmologist who tried to warn fellow practitioners about the 
                potential outbreak of a virus. Unfortunately, he was accused of making false claims and misleading the public. Dr. Li's warning did not depend on sophisticated laboratory testing or expensive 
                imaging studies, but on his own understanding of biological plausibility—the kind of analysis that clinicians of all specialties
                 could make. The New York Times reported that on January 10, 2020, Dr Li developeda cough after
                  having treated a woman for glaucoma who had unknowingly been infected with the coronavirus, probably by her daughter. 
                 No report suggests that he observed any ophthalmologic complications of the coronavirus infection in his patient.<br>
                 <img src="images/Dr_li.jpg"><br>
                 The 34-year-old eye specialist, in his Weibo story, revealed how he had come down with cough and fever after a month of his warning going unnoticed.<br><br>
                 The doctor had contracted the virus while treating a glaucoma case (suffering from corona virus) in Wuhan. Dr. Li passed away on February 7,
                  2020 leaving the people in China and worldwide grieving and angry.<br><br>
                 Another doctor who died of the disease in Wuhan was just 29 years old.
                  As per the reports, he had postponed his Lunar New Year marriage to serve humanity and treat patients who had been hit by the virus.
                 Unfortunately, he ended up contracting the virus from one of his patients and died a hero.

                Jean-Jacques Razafindranazy was the first French doctor who died while treating coronavirus patients. The 68-year-old accident and emergency department
